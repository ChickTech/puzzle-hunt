<p>
Because this is just a demo and we aren't using a very powerful server, we've capped the maximum upload size to 1 MB. That means you will not be able to submit high-resolution images. You may need to go into your Camera app and dial down the resolution setting. It's unlikely that the highest resolution will work, but one or two down from that ought to be OK.
