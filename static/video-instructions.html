<p>
Because this is just a demo and we aren't using a very powerful server, we've capped the maximum upload size to 1 MB. That means you will not be able to submit high-resolution videos. You may need to go into your Camera app and dial down the resolution setting. On cameras that support it, QVGA is the best choice. If you don't see that, then CIF should work as well. If your only low-resolution option is MMS, then go with that.
