<p>
We aren't using a very powerful server for this demo, so we've capped the maximum upload size to 1 MB. You may need to go into your Camera app and dial down the resolution setting. You should choose one of these options: QVGA, CIF, or MMS (should only be chosen if the other two aren't available).
